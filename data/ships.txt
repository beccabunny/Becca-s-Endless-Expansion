Their primary intention was to increase the weapon space to install more Ion Cannons, but since they were unable to do much they focused on the Solifuge development and, after it was completed, tried to increase the other attributes instead with good results at the cost of manuevrability and heat control."

	description `The introduction of humans to the Hai civilization has led to a substantial amount of cultural exchange. While some may argue that pickled acorns have been the greatest product of this relationship, many more will point to this luxury transport ship. The product of human-Hai cooperation from the project's inception, the Centipede was released around the turn of the 31st century, but has already become quite popular among Hai fleets.`

	description "This ship was first built millennia ago, near the end of a more violent time in Hai history. Since then, it has served as the only heavy warship at the disposal of the Hai. The Shield Beetle is a versatile warship used by the Hai to guard their merchant convoys, or by the Unfettered to attack those very same convoys."

	description "The design of the Water Bug is almost as old as the Aphid, but until recently it never saw much use. A spike in aggression from the Unfettered Hai has led the tougher and more well-defended Water Bug to see an increase in popularity over its little brother, the Aphid. The Water Bug is now the most widely used Hai freighter, comprising the bulk of all Hai merchant fleets."
